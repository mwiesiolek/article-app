1. What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but we’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

    My proudest achievement? I am really proud of my private projects that I implement in my free time. I've already rolled out couple of
Android applications which are available here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MW
    The rates are not very high but still, I am happy that I've released them on my own.

    Recently, I've also managed to finish java certifications (Java 7 Associate as well as Java 7 Professional). I am also aiming to
    pass next exams on expert level and upon that for architects.

2. Tell us about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why we should read it as well.

 - Patterns of enterprise application architecture, Martin Fowler

        It is a little bit outdated, but you can find some interesting ideas, conceptions in the book as well.

 - Java Concurrency in practice, Brian Goetz

        Everything about multithreading in one place. Every developer that has something in common with multithreading should read that book.
         In my opinion some topic could be even easier explained.

 - Seven Databases in Seven Weeks, Eric Redmond

        Awesome book about sql and no-sql solutions available on market. Briefly describes all seven tools which persist data.
